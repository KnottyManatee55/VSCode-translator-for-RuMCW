'''1.20.2''' is a minor update to {{el|je}}, released on September 21, 2023,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-20-2|Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.2|September 21, 2023}}</ref> which adds the Villager Trade Rebalance experimental toggle, the {{cmd|random}} command, changes diamond generation, and fixes bugs. It is not compatible with 1.20 to 1.20.1 servers.

== Нововведения ==
=== Формат команд ===
; {{cmd|random}}
* A new command for randomizing values and controlling random sequences.
** Syntaxes:
*** {{cmd|link=none|random (value{{!}}roll) <range> [<sequence>]}}: draw a random value.
*** {{cmd|link=none|random reset (*{{!}}<sequence>) [<seed>] [<includeWorldSeed>] [<includeSequenceId>]}}: control random sequences.
** Arguments:
*** <code>range</code>: A range of values to randomize between, inclusively. For instance, <code>1..6</code> is a regular D6 roll.
*** <code>sequence</code>: The name of a random sequence to sample or reset.
**** In {{cmd|link=none|random reset}}, <code>*</code> refers to all random sequences.
*** <code>seed</code>: A seed to use for the random sequence after reset.
*** <code>includeWorldSeed</code>: A boolean specifying whether to include the world seed when seeding the sequence. Defaults to <code>true</code>.
**** When <code>false</code>, it means the sequence will evaluate to the same regardless of which world the command is run in.
*** <code>includeSequenceId</code>: A boolean specifying whether to include the sequence ID when seeding the sequence. Defaults to <code>true</code>.
**** When <code>false</code>, it means all sequences will evaluate to the same regardless of which name they have.
** {{cmd|link=none|random (value{{!}}roll)}} notes:
*** When using <code>roll</code> rather than <code>value</code>, the resulting value is also shown in chat for all players.
*** When <code>sequence</code> not specified, this command can be executed by players without operator privileges.
** {{cmd|link=none|random reset}} notes:
*** By default, all sequences are seeded as {{cd|d=,|0|true|true}}.
*** Using <code>*</code> instead of a sequence ID resets all sequences and sets the default parameters.
*** If no seed is specified, the sequence resets to the default parameters.

=== Основное ===
; [[Атрибут]]ы
* Added the <code>generic.max_absorption</code> attribute.
** Acts similar to <code>generic.max_health</code>, but instead of being the upper bound for <code>Health</code>, it is the upper bound for <code>AbsorptionAmount</code>.
** The mob effect <code>absorption</code> increases <code>generic.max_absorption</code> as well as fills the <code>AbsorptionAmount</code> to the max when applied.

; [[Экспериментальный игровой процесс]]
* Added the "Villager Trade Rebalance" experimental toggle (<code>trade_rebalance</code> data pack).

; [[Game rule]]
* Added <code>enderPearlsVanishOnDeath</code>, controlling whether thrown ender pearls vanish when the player that threw them dies, defaults to <code>true</code>.

; [[Loot table]]
* Added <code>sequence</code> loot function.
** Contains 1 field:
*** <code>functions</code>: an array of sub-functions to run in sequence.
** Can also be declared as an inline array without a type.
*** This matches the existing behavior where loot function JSON files can be declared as an array of composite functions.
* <code>all_of</code> predicates in loot tables can now be declared implicitly as an inline array without a type.
** This similarly matches the existing behavior where loot predicate JSON files can be declared as an array of sub-predicates.

; [[Options]]
* Added "Narrator Hotkey" option to accessibility settings, opened by default.
** Pressing {{key|Ctrl+B}} will not open narrator if it is turned off.

; <samp>[[options.txt]]</samp>
* Added <code>narratorHotkey</code>, defaults to <code>true</code>.

; [[Social interactions]]
* Player skins and names can now be reported in the social interactions screen.
** Like chat reports, player skin and name reports are handled by a human.
** If a skin or name is reported, and found to be violating the Community Standards, following actions can be take by Minecraft moderators:
*** Ban the skin from being used by any player.
*** Ban the name from being used by any player.
*** Suspend the player from online play in the case of repeated offences.
** When a skin is banned, players with that skin:
*** Will have their skin removed.
*** Will be notified when they launch the game.
*** Will be automatically assigned one of the default skins.
*** Can still play multiplayer and singleplayer.
*** Can select a new custom skin at any time.
** When a player's name is banned, that player:
*** Will need to choose a new name.
*** Will be notified when they launch the game.
*** Will not be able to play online until they change their name.
*** Can still play singleplayer.
** A skin or name that has been banned cannot be used by any player in the future.
* Added following report category:
** I want to report them
*** I'm annoyed with them / they have done something I do not like.

; [[Тег]]и
* Added the following block tags:
** {{cd|#camel_sand_step_sound_blocks}}: contains {{cd|d=and|#sand|#concrete_powder}}.
** {{cd|#concrete_powder}}: contains all types of concrete powders.
* Added the following damage type tags:
** {{cd|#always_kills_armor_stands}}: contains {{cd|d=and|arrow|trident|mob_projectile|fireball|wither_skull}}.
*** Damage types included in this tag should always fully kill an [[armor stand]].
** {{cd|#no_knockback}}: contains {{cd|d=and|explosion|player_explosion|bad_respawn_point}}.
*** Causes knockback to not be caused by the damage itself. Used in Vanilla for damage that is caused by events, such as explosions, which apply knockback separately.
* Added the following entity tag:
** {{cd|#non_controlling_rider}}: contains {{cd|d=and|slime|magma_cube}}.
*** Represents entities that don't override their vehicles movement control.

; Основное
* Changed mob attack reach calculation.
** In horizontal directions, mobs' attack reach are now their bounding box extended in horizontal directions, instead of using horizontal width to determine.
*** For example, a ravager won't be able to attack through a few block thick walls.
** In vertical directions, mobs' attack reach are now the exact vertical range of their bounding box. When there's no overlap between their bounding box and their target's bounding box in vertical direction, they can not attack, in specific:
*** Riding a medium-sized mob (e.g. horse) can get rid of attacks from short mobs (e.g. baby zombie).
*** Riding a tall mob (e.g. camel) can get rid of attacks from standard size mobs (e.g. zombie).
*** Some mob's reaching height now extended (e.g. enderman, safety height changed from 1.5 to 3).

=== Сущности, не являющиеся мобами ===
; [[Display]] entities
* Display entities now start updating their client-side position and rotation on the first tick after an update.
** In previous versions, updates were applied in the same tick, causing uneven motion.
** New behavior is now similar to armor stands, mobs and players.
* On the server, position and rotation are still updated immediately.
* Duration of this interpolation is controlled by the field <code>teleport_duration</code>.
** <code>0</code> means that updates are applied immediately.
** <code>1</code> means that the display entity will move from current position to the updated one over one tick.
** Higher values spread the movement over multiple ticks.
** Please note that this value is clamped to avoid glitches due to periodic position updates.
** The new value will apply only to position and rotation changes made after it changed.
*** That means any current movement will continue unchanged.
* Note: behavior while riding remains unchanged from previous versions.

=== Генерация мира ===
; [[Ore]] distribution
* [[Diamond ore]] is now generated more frequently in the [[deepslate]] layers of the Overworld.
** Added a new ore blob placement: Uniform distributed, from height -64 to -4, with blob size 8, generation frequency 2 and a 50% chance of discarding when exposed to air.
** Other existing diamond ore placements remain untouched.

=== Формат команд ===
; [[Функция|Функции]]
* A single backslash <code>\</code> as the last non-whitespace character of a line now allows a command to be continued on the next line.
** Leading and trailing whitespace of the following line are stripped before appending.
* Functions can now contain macro lines, making them Function Macros.
** Any line beginning with <code>$</code> (as the first non-space character) marks a macro line.
** A macro line also contains one or more substitutions in the form of <code>$(variable)</code>.
*** Commands with variable subsitutions will be re-evaluated after substitution.
**** Running commands with this type have extra cost compared to pre-parsed functions.
**** Game will attempt to cache the result of certain parameter set being used in a call, to reduce costs when repeatedly calling.
** When calling a function macro a compound with data for all argument variables must be provided.
* Numbers used as macro arguments are now always inserted without suffixes, regardless of numeric type.

; {{cmd|function}}
* Extended command usage, now supported parameters for function macro's variable substitution.
** New syntax: {{cmd|link=none|function <name> [<arguments>{{!}}with (block <sourcePos>{{!}}entity <sou<nowiki/>rce>{{!}}storage <sou<nowiki/>rce>) [<path>]]}}
** New arguments:
*** <code>arguments</code>: A data compound, enclosed in <code>{}</code>.
*** Data source: A data source specification, like what could already be used for {{cmd|data get}}.
*** <code>path</code>: An NBT path specification.
** The data source and <code>path</code> must specify a compound data entry.
** The compound must contain one entry for each variable used in the macro.
** More data may be present in the compound and if so is ignored.
** Calling a non-macro function with a data compound is silently ignored.
** When a macro is called, the values provided are substituted in place of the variable specifications and the resulting commands are executed.
*** In order to improve performance when repeatedly calling with the same parameter, values in the provided compound which are referenced in macro as parameters will be cached.
** Any syntax errors in the lines resulting from variable substitution result in the entire function call being skipped.

; {{cmd|item}}
* Can now replace items in [[jukebox]]es.
* Can now remove items in [[chiseled bookshelves]].

; Основное
* History of used commands is now saved and accessible across worlds.
** The last 50 commands that are sent in chat will be remembered across game sessions.
** The command and chat history can be accessed by pressing {{key|UP}} or {{key|DOWN}} in the chat.
** Regular chat is only persisted within the same game session (leaving a server or world clears them).
** Recent commands are stored in <code>command_history.txt</code> in the game folder.

=== Игровой процесс ===
; [[Достижение (Java Edition)|Достижения]]

*** <code>Ambient</code> -> <code>ambient</code>
*** <code>Amplifier</code> -> <code>amplifier</code>
*** <code>Duration</code> -> <code>duration</code>
*** <code>ShowParticles</code> -> <code>show_particles</code>
*** <code>ShowIcon</code> -> <code>show_icon</code>
*** <code>HiddenEffect</code> -> <code>hidden_effect</code>
**** This field is a mob effect instance, so changes to the parent also applied here, recursively.
*** <code>FactorCalculationData</code> -> <code>factor_calculation_data</code>
* In NBT format for block entity type <code>beacon</code>:
** <code>Primary</code> (integer) -> <code>primary_effect</code> (string, resource location)
** <code>Secondary</code> (integer) -> <code>secondary_effect</code> (string, resource location)

; [[Такт#Такт блоков|Такт чанков]]
* <code>randomTickSpeed</code> [[game rule]] now affects the rate of accumulation of [[snow]] and [[ice]] the same way it affects crops and other blocks.

; [[Набор данных]]

** If <code>true</code>, the pattern texture will be masked based on the underlying armor.

; [[Экран отладки]]
* Values in the <code>SH</code> row will now show up as question marks when playing on a server, instead of wrong values.
* When hitboxes are displayed through {{key|F3+B}}, entities that have a passenger will display the passenger's attachment point.
* Renamed "Debug" row to "Debug charts", and changed its style.
** "Pie" chart now called "Profiler" chart.
* The charts on the debug screen can now be toggled with the key combinations {{key|F3+1}} (profiler chart) and {{key|F3+2}} (FPS and TPS) instead of {{key|Shift+F3}} and {{key|Alt+F3}}.
* Press key combination {{key|F3+3}} will now show charts for ping and received network traffic.
* Debug screen no longer be closed while switching charts.
* Multiple charts now can appears at the same time, unless it's conflict with each other.

** Removed {{cd|d=and|EffectId|EffectDuration}}.
** Added <code>stew_effects</code>, with the same format as <code>effects</code> field in <code>suspicious_stew</code> item format.
* In NBT format for entity type <code>area_effect_cloud</code>:
** Renamed <code>Effects</code> to <code>effects</code>.
* In NBT format for entity type <code>arrow</code>:
** Renamed <code>CustomPotionEffects</code> to <code>custom_potion_effects</code>.
* In NBT format for living entities (players, armor stands, and all mobs):

; Экраны многопользовательской игры и выбора мира
* Renamed "Cancel" button to "Back".

; Метаданные набора данных
* New features have been added to datapacks and resource packs to allow creation of packs that are compatible with multiple versions of the game.
** Pack metadata now includes an optional field <code>supported_formats</code> which describes a range for pack formats that this pack supports.
*** Examples: <code>16</code>, <code>[16,17]</code>, <code>{"min_inclusive": 16, "max_inclusive": 17}</code>
** <code>pack_format</code> field is still required and its format remains unchanged, to allow older game versions to read pack data.
*** If <code>supported_formats</code> is present, it must contain the value declared in <code>pack_format</code>.
*** Since this new information is ignored by older versions of the game, they will always see a "normal", single-version pack, without any extended compatibility.
* Packs can now contain overlay directories ("overlays").
** Overlays are sub-packs applied over the "normal" contents of a pack.
*** These directories have the same layout as the top-level pack, including the <code>assets</code> and <code>data</code> directories.
*** Overlays can be applied if they support the client's pack format.
*** Overlays can add and replace files, but not remove them.
**** For example, if the overlay <code>foo</code> is applied, the file <code>foo/assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png</code> will replace contents of <code>assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png</code>.
*** <code>pack.mcmeta</code> and <code>pack.png</code> are ignored in overlay directories.
** New section called <code>overlays</code> have been added to pack metadata.
*** It contains an <code>entries</code> field, containing a list of overlays.
*** Every overlay entry has two fields:
**** <code>formats</code> - range of supported formats
**** <code>directory</code> - overlay directory (allowed characters: {{cd|d=and|a-z|0-9|_|-}})
** Order of application: overlays are stacked from the bottom to top of the list.
*** For example, if a pack has two overlays: <code>"entries": [{"directory":"A", ...}, {"directory":"B", ...}]</code>, the game will first look in B, then A and then in the top pack directory.

; [[player.dat format]]
* In NBT format for item type {{cd|d=and|potion|lingering_potion|splash_potion|tipped_arrow}}:
** Renamed <code>CustomPotionEffects</code> to <code>custom_potion_effects</code>.
* In NBT format for item type <code>suspicious_stew</code>:
** Renamed <code>Effects</code> to <code>effects</code>, also changed following fields in this field:
*** <code>EffectId</code> (integer) -> <code>id</code> (string, resource location)
*** <code>EffectDuration</code> -> <code>duration</code>

; Протокол
* Optimized the way chunks are sent to clients to allow players with low-bandwidth internet connections to play on multiplayer servers.
** Chunks are no longer sent over the network to the client in one big continuous batch.
** They are instead sent in smaller batches depending on the available bandwidth. This means that:
*** Clients with extremely low-bandwidth connections will not time out while loading the world.
*** Clients with low-bandwidth connections can interact with the world while some chunks are still loading.
** Only chunks within the client's render distance are now sent.
** Gameplay packets are now packed into bigger TCP-packets to reduce overhead from TCP-headers, significantly reducing network usage.
* Changed network protocol to allow for more data-driven content in the future.
** Configuration phase automatically starts after login phase (i.e. after client account has been verified) and lasts until the player joins the world (play phase).
** Clients can stay in configuration phase indefinitely - it's up to server to release it to the world.
** Servers can also request clients to re-enter the configuration phase after it has entered the play phase.
*** Other players will see such clients as disconnected.
** Users in configuration phase will not be visible on the player list.
** Actions allowed in configuration phase (moved from play phase).
*** Configuration of data-driven registries.
*** Configuration of enabled features.
** Actions shared between configuration and play phases:
*** Application of server resource packs.
*** Update of tags.
*** Exchange of custom packets.
*** Ping and keep-alive packets.
** The server will now negotiate resource pack in the configuration phase.
*** This means that the player will no longer be in world when answering prompts and reloading resources.
* Client options are now sent during the configuration network phase when joining a server.

; [[Resource pack]]
* The version is now <code>18</code>.
** The process of upgrading a pack can be assisted by using an automated Slicer tool.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1</ref>
** All textures containing multiple sprites in a sheet for GUI have been split into individual sprites under <code>textures/gui/sprites</code> (automated by Slicer tool).
** All textures in the <code>realms</code> namespace have been moved into the <code>minecraft</code> namespace (automated by Slicer tool).
** <code>villager2.png</code> has been renamed to <code>villager.png</code> (automated by Slicer tool).

** The bundle tooltip background is now drawn as a nine-sliced sprite.
** The icons for the Accessibility, Language, Realms News buttons have been split from their underlying button texture.
** The Realms Invite button is now drawn as an overlay on the normal button texture.

** The exclamation marks on the <code>notification\more.png</code> have been removed.
** The text field background is now a nine-sliced sprite at {{cd|d=and|widget/text_field|widget/text_field_highlighted}}.
** The scroll bar in lists and text fields is now a nine-sliced sprite at <code>widget/scroller</code>.

; [[Система счёта игровых событий]]
* The <code>belowName</code> display slot selector is now <code>below_name</code>.

; [[server.properties]]
* Added new <code>log-ips</code> option (defaults to <code>true</code>).
** When set to <code>false</code>, will prevent player IPs from being included in the log when players join the game.

; [[Social interactions]]

* Changed trades of armorers:
** Buying diamond armor now also requires a small amount of diamonds.
** Most master-level armorers buy iron blocks and pay 4 emeralds for them.
** Chainmail armor is exclusively sold by jungle and swamp armorers.
** The savanna armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices.
** The taiga armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another.
